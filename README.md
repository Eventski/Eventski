# Eventski
Find events at your favorite ski mountains. 

#Synopsis
Eventski allows ski and music enthusiasts to make the most of their day at the slopes. A user can input the region in which they're planning to visit (resort name, town, zip etc.) and see a list of neighboring mountains. From there a user can select a resort and see all events coming up at that location and the surrounding area. Custom user pages allow people to add events to their calendar and plan day trips/vacations.
